# snowflake-builder
Motivational idea:  When we simulate a snowflake we know one macroscopic physical rule for six-fold symmetry.  While governed by the same physical processes, the growth of the snowflake on the microscopic scale is responding to unknown subtle initial and temporal forcing functions.  To solve this problem, we model the initial and forcing function as a random process.  By empirically adjusting the parameters of the random process we can get results that on a macro scale agree pretty well with nature.  

 

Scientists and engineers do this to model many complex physical systems in nature.

 

We also do this a lot to make computer-generated images resemble  shapes, motions and patterns in nature that are indistinguishable from natural images.

 

The  Game:  Use a computer code and adjust random parameters to generate images that look like real snowflakes in nature.

Here is what you should do to get started:

 

0. Read a few short articles on the formation of snowflakes in nature.

 

1.  Install the PROCESSING API from     https://processing.org/download/

 

That will give you ability to execute processing in both Java and javascript.  Java is an older version but legacy scripts are written in Java.   We only want to use javascript (the JS library is p5.js) but we may get ideas from the legacy codes.

 

2.  Go to this URL    https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/492405  in openprocessing.org

 

When you press the key "o" you have options.

The p5.js source code is also at the same URL

 

Study the code and learn what each option does.  

 

3.  Find and study other codes for generating snowflake images

 

4,  Find at least 10 quality images of real snowflakes.to act as target images in the game.

 

5.  Modify the JS code in step 2 to have an option to draw just one arm of the snowflake and then render all six arms of the snowflake with the same random set.
